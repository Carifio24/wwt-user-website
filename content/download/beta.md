# Read This First

First, some disclaimers for “production” installations of WWT, such as
planetariums and kiosks:

- While the WWT team strives to keep the Windows application functioning as
  reliably as possible, the latest version of WWT includes internal changes that
  may break existing use cases. **Do not install the newest version in
  production scenarios without significant advance testing.**
- Likewise, the WWT team provides user support on a best-effort basis. We aspire
  to provide a high level of service but *cannot* guarantee timely technical
  assistance.
- If you have any questions about this, contact the team at <a
  href="mailto:wwt@aas.org">wwt@aas.org</a>.

# System Requirements

The latest version of WWT runs on Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11, in either 32- or 64-bit
mode. It supports native DirectX 10 and 11, and has some support for down-level
DirectX 9 hardware running through the DirectX 11 API.

Do not attempt to install recent versions of WWT on operating systems older than
Windows 7. It will not run and can potentially prevent the legacy version from
running.

### Recommended System Requirements

- Any recent CPU
- 8+ GB system memory
- Discrete GPU with 1+ GB VRAM and DirectX 11 compatibility
