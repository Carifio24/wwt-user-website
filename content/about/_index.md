The [American Astronomical Society][aas] (AAS) is a founding sponsor of the
WorldWide Telescope project and assisted with its transition from a commercial
to an Open Source effort.  Significant financial, administrative, and
programmatic support enabled the fully open realization of this amazing
resource, which continues to be utilized throughout the astronomical community
for a variety of educational and research-related efforts.

# Purpose Statement

The purpose of the WorldWide Telescope project is to enable the seamless
visualization and sharing of scientific data and stories from major telescopes,
observatories, and institutions among students and researchers, through science
museums and full-dome immersive planetariums, and in scholarly publications.


# Project History

The original conception of the WorldWide Telescope project dates back to at
least 2002, when legendary database researcher [Jim Gray] envisioned a system
to organize the world’s astronomical imagery in the same way that his
[Terraserver] project was organizing imagery of the Earth. Jim’s tragic
[disappearance at sea] in 2007 spurred his colleagues at [Microsoft Research]
(MSR) to launch an undertaking to turn his dream into a reality, recruiting 3D
graphics expert and astronomy enthusiast [Jonathan Fay] to lead the software
development in collaboration with professional educators and astronomers like
Harvard professor [Alyssa Goodman].

The WWT [Windows client] was
[first publicly demonstrated in February 2008][ted-2008] at a TED conference.
Just a year later, the first edition of WWT as a web application
[was released][wwt-web-app]. In the ensuing years at MSR, the WWT system
acquired many now-familiar features,
[delighted millions of planetarium-goers][cosmic-wonder], expanded its scope
to areas such as [earth and planetary science][wwt-planetary], and reached
[millions of downloads and active users][downloads].

In 2014, reorganizations within MSR left the WorldWide Telescope project
looking for a new institutional home. Microsoft made the bold decision to
[take the project to open-source][open-sourcing], transferring the project
intellectual property to the [.NET Foundation][dnf] and releasing the source
code [on GitHub][github] under the permissive [MIT License]. With
[support from the National Science Foundation][nsf-1550701], a task force
convened to chart a new course for the project.

After a thorough search, in 2016 it was [announced][aas-announcement] that the
WWT project would be taken on by the non-profit
[American Astronomical Society][aas] (AAS), the major organization of
professional astronomers in North America. The [mission][aas-mission] of the
AAS is to “Enhance and share humanity’s scientific understanding of the
universe,” making the two a natural pairing.

In 2023, the project graduated to fiscal sponsorship by [NumFOCUS], a nonprofit
dedicated to supporting the open-source scientific computing community.

While NumFOCUS helps the project manage certain core assets, openness to all
comers is a core value, and the WWT [governance model](@/about/governance.md)
aspires to embody that value. If you’d like to get involved in the WWT
community, [connect with us](@/connect.md) and introduce yourself!
