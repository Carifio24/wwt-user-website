The purpose of the American Astronomical Society's WorldWide Telescope project
is to enable the seamless visualization and sharing of scientific data and
stories from major telescopes, observatories, and institutions among students
and researchers, through science museums and full-dome immersive planetariums,
and in scholarly publications.
