It’s not a physical telescope — it’s a suite of **free and open source**
software and data sets that combine to create stunning scientific
visualizations and stories.

The WWT ecosystem includes a [Windows application][windows-client], an
[interactive web app][web-client], and toolkits for [Python][pywwt] and
[TypeScript/JavaScript][webgl].

[windows-client]: @/download/_index.md#windows-client
[web-client]: /webclient/
[pywwt]: https://pywwt.readthedocs.io/
