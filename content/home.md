It’s not a physical telescope — it’s a suite of **free and open source**
software and data sets that combine to create stunning scientific
visualizations and stories.

The WWT ecosystem includes a [Windows application][windows-client], an
[interactive web app][web-client], and toolkits for [Python][pywwt] and
[TypeScript/JavaScript][webgl].

<b>Open source</b> and <b>open data</b> are at the core of WWT’s design. No
need to ask for permission — you can remix your own images, 3D models, tours,
maps, and more into the WWT environment.
