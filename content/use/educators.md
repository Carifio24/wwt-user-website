WorldWide Telescope empowers learners of all ages to explore the universe
interactively and in three dimensions. Not only is this cool, it’s effective!
But you don’t have to take our word for it — check out the materials and
research of the [Cosmic Data Stories][cosmicds] (CosmicDS) and [WWT Ambassadors][ambassadors]
(WWTA) programs. These are both efforts based at the [Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian][cfa]
that use WWT to transform classroom astronomy education:

# Creating Your Own Labs with WWT Tours

**Tours** are scripted, multimedia experiences that guide the viewer through
WWT’s simulated universe. They look like movies, but when viewed in WWT, you
can pause a tour to explore regions of the sky that catch your interest, or
click on hyperlinks to learn more about an object or phenomenon.
